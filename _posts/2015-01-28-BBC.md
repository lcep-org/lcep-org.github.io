**"BBC Pop Up: Life as a young Native American in South Dakota"** was broadcast in January 2015 and is set up on their webpage this way: “Life on Indian reservations in the US is often marked by a combination of crushing poverty and chronic alcoholism. In South Dakota, where 70,000 Native Americans live on various reservations, young people are all too aware of the tough reality they face. But as BBC Pop Up’s Benjamin Zand reports, many are also determined to move beyond the negative stereotypes and chart their own course in life.” If you cannot access the 5 minute video below, visit [this link](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-30659678){:target="_blank"} to go directly to the BBC website.
