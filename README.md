# The Lakota Cultural Exchange Program

Under construction! Revamping/updating the website for better longevity.

This site is primarily maintained for archival purposes. For updates on our current work, visit [siriusb.org](https://siriusb.org/).

For a record of the old (pre-revamp) site, see [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250206121044/http://www.thelakotaculturalexchangeprogram.org/), noting that some media are not preserved depending on the Internet Archive capture.
