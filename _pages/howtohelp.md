<!-- #### How You Can Help -->

While the made-with-love brochure about hosting isn’t relevant for the program’s current iteration, it conveys something of the spirit of this whole endeavor. That spirit extends to how to help, in general. For those most comfortable with offering monetary support, donations will always be welcome across active fundraising, as will any involvement with planning or implementation of the STEM weekends most recently implemented at Northwestern University. Just cheering us on, or sharing what we’re trying to do is also a great way to contribute. Like in all similar efforts, every little bit helps and is always deeply appreciated.
