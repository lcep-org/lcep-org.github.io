In the years since this program was established (more than a decade ago already!), we’ve undergone some serious changes. What began as a girls-helping-girls initiative to empower through enrichment and self-defense at [Thousand Waves Martial Arts & Self-Defense Center](https://thousandwaves.org){:target="_blank"} in Chicago, IL evolved into first a [music program](https://thelakotaculturalexchangeprogram.org/music-outreach/) and later a fully established [STEM curriculum]((https://thelakotaculturalexchangeprogram.org/stem-outreach/)). Click through the links here (and/or head on over to our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/nikisnuts){:target="_blank"}) to see what we’ve been up to for the last ten years.
